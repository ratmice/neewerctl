A controller for neewer lights written in rust
It has a gui interface written in druid, and uses btleplug for bluetooth.

It in theory should be cross platform, been run on linux, and windows,
The libraries should all support MacOS, but this has not been tested.

Lights that currently work:
* RGB-480

Gratitude towards the authors of NeewerLite @keefo, and NeewerLite-Python @taburineagle
for figuring out the protocols used on these devices.
as well as the authors of druid and btleplug for the libraries which were a joy to use.
